# Honey_encryption in Python

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This program demonstrates the honey encryption algorithm. When a user
is prompted to enter a password and a message, the password is then
used to create 'sweetwords' or passwords very similar to the original that a
malicious hacker may try in order to see the secret message. However, when
a sweetword is entered instead of the password, the program outputs an intruder
alarm and a fake message.
